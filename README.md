# Sees the Day - Workday Scheduler

## Description

- This application is a scheduling tool for the typical workday
- I made this to provide a simple method of tracking daily tasks, in order to help with work orginazation
- While making this application I learned how to use a lot of useful tools like Day.js and the U of T Xpert Learning Assistant
- I also became a lot more familiar with JQuiery after gaining more practice with this project
